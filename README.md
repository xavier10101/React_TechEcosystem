# React_TechEcosystem

First attempts to build ideas

Ideas:
1) Create an application which can be hosted on a website with the following specs for MVP:
a. Website will have tech ecosystem laid out like a map, with various subdomains as landmasses on map
b. Hovering over a landmass will highlight, clicking will "zoom and enhance" to subdomain
c. Subdomain (job family) will be laid out like RPG classes (maybe) with more information
d. Skillset attached to jobs (might need a database, especially for post-mvp)
2) Create a website to host application
3) Add application to website


Post MVP:
3 opportunities:

CTO)
I'm looking to do X, what roles do I need to accomplish this

College Student)
Help me find a career path
>What skills/classes should I take to achieve my desired career
>What do companies look for for entry-level positions
>What degrees work well to get into entry-level roles

Job Searcher)
How do I get into tech / what roles in tech are out there
